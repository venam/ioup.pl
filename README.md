IOUP.pl
======

About
-----
This is the Perl version of [ioup](https://github.com/deadcat64/ioup). <br>
I've added some new features:
* upload/remove multiple files at the same time
* error handling
* removing file by name or token instead of just by token.
* list available files with full links

Dependencies
------------
To run ioup.pl you'll need `Net::Curl::Form`.
